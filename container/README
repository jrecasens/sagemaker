To test locally, can use this set of docker commands:

cd container
./doclocal.sh rnn
cd local_test/
./serve_local.sh rnn
./predict.sh testdata.csv text/csv

docker ps
docker stop <Id>
docker rm <Id> 

PS: Test and web versions notably differ in how predictor.py reads data: StringIO.StringIO(data) needs be used before opening the CSV file when running locally, while CSV needs be read directly when on Flask (this can be set with variable s_on in line 79)
